# SnoFlake Compiler Project

This project contains a simple compiler and integrated development environment (IDE) for the SnoFlake programming language. SnoFlake is a custom language with a syntax that is translated into C++ for execution.

## Project Files

* **`snoflake_compiler.py`**: This file contains the complete SnoFlake IDE, including:
    * The SnoFlake transpiler logic (tokenization and translation).
    * A `Tkinter`-based graphical user interface with a text editor for writing SnoFlake code and a console for displaying output and errors.
    * Functionality to run the SnoFlake code by transpiling it to C++, compiling the C++ code using `g++`, and then executing the resulting binary.
* **`transpiler.py`**: This file contains only the core transpiler logic for the SnoFlake language. It includes:
    * A dictionary `KEYWORDS` that maps SnoFlake keywords to their C++ equivalents.
    * A `tokenize` function that breaks down SnoFlake code into individual tokens.
    * A `transpile` function that takes a list of tokens and translates them into C++ code.

## SnoFlake Language Basics

The SnoFlake language includes the following keywords and features:

* **`truefalse`**: Translates to `bool` in C++.
* **`integer`**: Translates to `int` in C++.
* **`character`**: Translates to `char` in C++.
* **`nonchanging`**: Translates to `const` in C++.
* **`stoploop`**: Translates to `break` in C++.
* **`option`**: Translates to `case` in C++.
* **`none`**: Used for functions that do not return a value (translates to `void`, except for the `main` function which is translated to `int` as required by C++).
* **`say`**: Used for outputting to the console, similar to `std::cout` in C++. You can use `endl` within a `say` statement for a newline.

## How to Run

To run the SnoFlake IDE:

1.  Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Save the `snoflake_compiler.py` file.
3.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4.  Run the command: `python snoflake_compiler.py`

This will open the SnoFlake IDE window. You can then write SnoFlake code in the editor, click the "â–¶ Run" button to execute it, and see the output in the console below. The "ðŸ§¹ Clear Console" button will clear the output area.

To use the standalone transpiler (`transpiler.py`):

1.  Save the `transpiler.py` file.
2.  You can import the `transpile` function into another Python script and use it to translate SnoFlake code.

    ```python
    from transpiler import tokenize, transpile

    snoflake_code = "integer main() { say \"Hello, SnoFlake!\" endl; return 0; }"
    tokens = tokenize(snoflake_code)
    cpp_code = transpile(tokens)
    print(cpp_code)
    ```

    **Note:** The standalone `transpiler.py` does not handle the extraction of the `main` function or the inclusion of necessary C++ headers. The `snoflake_compiler.py` provides a more complete translation process for runnable code.

## Example SnoFlake Code

```snoflake
integer main() {
  say "Hello from SnoFlake!" endl;
  integer count = 0;
  nonchanging integer limit = 5;

  while (count < limit) {
    say "Count is: " count endl;
    count = count + 1;
    if (count == 3) {
      say "Reached three!" endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
